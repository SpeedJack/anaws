\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusion}

The dual ascent algorithm gives an alternative to the traditional Dijkstra. It
is very powerful in terms of costs if the topology has some non-target nodes.
The price to pay is the execution time, because dual ascent has to consider all
the nodes for his solution. 

So, this algorithm isn't scalable and can't be used into huge topologies, but is
perfect in little local topologies where only a set of nodes have to be reached.
