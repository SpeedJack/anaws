\chapter{Dual Ascent}\label{ch:dualascent}

The dual ascent algorithm is the dual version for the problem of the minimum
\emph{Steiner} tree, which tries to find a directed subtree that connects a
root node to a selected subset of existing nodes. If in the Steiner tree the
purpose is to minimize the total cost of the links used in the resulting
broadcast tree, in the dual ascent version the goal is to maximize a quantity
derived by the costs, named \emph{slack}. Both versions find the same lower
bound for the optimal solution, according to the mathematical definition of a
dual problem.

The minimum Steiner tree problem is defined as in \eqref{eq:primalproblem}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:primalproblem}
	\begin{cases}
		\min\sum\limits_{(i,j) \in E} c_{ij}y_{ij}\\
		\sum\limits_{i \in N_1} \sum\limits_{j \in \overline{N_1}}
		y_{ij} \geq 1 & \forall N_1 \subseteq N : 1 \in N_1\
		\mathrm{and}\ N_1 \cap V \neq \emptyset\\
		y_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where \(E\) is the set of links; \(c_{ij}\) are the costs of the complete graph
for the link that goes from the node i to the node j; \(y_{ij}\) is a binary
variable which tells if the arc (i, j) is taken into the solution; \(N\) is the
whole set of nodes; \(V\) is the set of target nodes.

From linear programming, we can derive the dual of the problem in
\eqref{eq:primalproblem}. This is shown in \eqref{eq:dualproblem}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dualproblem}
	\begin{cases}
		\max\sum\limits_{k \in V} R_k^k\\
		R_j^k - R_i^k - w_{ij}^k \leq 0 & k \in V\\
		\sum\limits_{k \in V} w_{ij}^k \leq c_{ij} & (i, j) \in E\\
		w_{ij}^k \geq 0
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where \(R_i^k\) is the dual cost value computed to reach node i, selecting the
node k as root component and \(w_{ij}^k\) is the maximum slack between
the node i and the node j. The value is computed at each step calculating the
difference between the current \(c_{ij}\) and the last \(w_{ij}^k\) recorded
(initialized to 0).

The dual ascent algorithm aims to solve the dual problem.
