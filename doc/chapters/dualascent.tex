\chapter{Dual Ascent}\label{ch:dualascent}

The dual ascent algorithm is the dual version for the problem of the minimum
\emph{Steiner} tree, which tries to find a directed subtree that connects a
root node to a selected subset of existing nodes. If in the Steiner tree the
purpose is to minimize the total cost of the links used in the resulting
broadcast tree, in the dual ascent version the goal is to maximize a quantity
derived by the costs, named \emph{slack}. Both versions find the same lower
bound for the optimal solution, according to the mathematical definition of a
dual problem.
