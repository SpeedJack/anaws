\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

Floodlight is an open source and Java based controller. It works with the
OpenFlow protocol to produce flow table for network switches and is used mainly
for SDN (Software Defined Networks) to improve flexibility for large scale and
complex network management.

Normally Floodlight makes used of the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum
cost broadcast tree for the network topology.

For this project we implement a new module which manages routing, implementing a
different type of algorithm to replace Dijkstra, based on the Dual Ascent
approach, a dual version of the problem for the minimum Steiner tree.

We will then collect statistics on the total cost of the broadcast tree produced
by Dijkstra and the dual ascent algorithm and we will compare them. We will also
compare the throughput between hosts when the two algorithms are used using the
\code{iperf} tool.
