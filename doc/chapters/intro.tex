\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

Floodlight is an open source and Java based controller. It works with the
OpenFlow protocol to produce flow table for network switches and is used mainly
for SDN (Software Defined Networks) to improve flexibility for large scale and
complex network management.

%FIXME: not so clear (?!?)
%The communication between an SDN controller and the switches are done by the
%help of OpenFlow. Floodlight preserves all network rules and gives several
%directions for the processes on network traffic. It also works on the networks
%comprising the switches on SDN and the traditional networks together.

For this project we implement a new module which manages routing (the default
one uses Dijkstra algorithm to inspect the network topology), implementing a
different type of algorithm, based on the Dual Ascent approach, a dual version
of the problem for the minimum Steiner tree.
