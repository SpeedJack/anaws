\section{Bandwidth}\label{sec:bandwidth}

The first group of experiments regards the bandwidth and is done using only the
topology called ``paper topology'', shown in \figref{fig:papertopo}, with only
three hosts that has to communicate. This is the topology used in the paper of
\citeauthor{ilhan-kaplan-dualascent}. For each experiment 30 results are
collected and aggregated with the average. Each experiments collects 15 seconds
of TCP traffic.

\subsection{Equal link bandwidth}

For this experiment all the links have the same bandwidth (unlimited; the only
limit is the computational limit of the CPU). In
\figref{subfig:band-eq-dijkstra} we show the various average throughputs for the
host-to-host paths when the Dijkstra's algorithm is used. In
\figref{subfig:band-eq-dual} we have the analogue for the dual ascent algorithm.

	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{\textwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Comparison of the host-to-host throughput when using Dijkstra
	and dual ascent}\label{fig:bandwidth-equallinks}
\end{figure}

To have a final result we have aggregated all the path's throughputs to show
what algorithm seems to be the best. As we can see from
\figref{fig:band-aggregate-eq}, Dijkstra has an average throughput in time
always better with respect to Dual Ascent (\(\SI{44}{\gigabits\per\second}\) vs
\(\SI{38.5}{\gigabits\per\second}\)), but both has a similar shape and setup time
(the throughput is lower in the first two seconds, due to TCP slow start).

	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{img/aggregate-band-eq.png}

		link}\label{fig:band-aggregate-eq}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Different link bandwidth}

For this experiment links have different bandwidth. The bandwidth for each link
has been set to the sum of the indexes of the attached switches (two for each
link), multiplied by a factor of 25 (in Mbits/s). In
\figref{subfig:band-div-dijkstra} we have the average throughputs when the
Dijkstra's algorithm is used and in \figref{subfig:band-div-dual} there is the
analogue for the Dual ascent algorithm.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/band-div-dijkstra.png}
		\caption{Throughput in time when the Dijkstra's algorithm is
		used with different link
	bandwidth}\label{subfig:band-div-dijkstra}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/band-div-dual.png}
		\caption{Throughput in time when the Dual Ascent algorithm is
		used with different link bandwidth}\label{subfig:band-div-dual}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Comparison of the host-to-host throughput when using Dijkstra
	and dual ascent in the topology with links with different
	bandwidths}\label{fig:bandwidth-difflinks}
\end{figure}

The final aggregation, shown in \figref{fig:band-aggregate-div}, tells that in
this case Dual Ascent has an average throughput in time always better with
respect to Dijkstra (\(\SI{179}{\megabits\per\second}\) vs
\(\SI{165}{\megabits\per\second}\)), with a different shape only in the first
two seconds.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/aggregate-band-div.png}
	\caption{Aggregate mean for the throughput with links with different
	bandwidths}\label{fig:band-aggregate-div}
\end{figure}

As we can see results are similar, because all the nodes are considered as
target nodes. So there isn't so many difference between the two algorithm and
this is shown by the fact that in one case Dijkstra is better and in the other
cases it is not. To have different results we have to set some nodes as
non-target, but this is not supported by Floodlight as it wants to compute every
time the broadcast tree with all nodes of the network.
